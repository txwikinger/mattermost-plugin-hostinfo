# Mattermost Hostinfo Plugin [![CircleCI branch](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-hostinfo/master.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-hostinfo)

This plugin has been based off Mattermost Plugin Starter Template repository.

To learn more about plugins, see [our plugin documentation](https://developers.mattermost.com/extend/plugins/).

## What does it do?

The hostinfo plugin provides information about a host (via dns domain name or ip address). In its first draft it 
provides the geoip address, however incremnetal feature enhancements are planned for the future.

    /hostinfo show [DNS domain] - retrieves and presents information about the given DNS domain.
    /hostinfo help - shows this help information.


## Development

To avoid having to manually install your plugin, build and deploy your plugin using one of the following options.

### Deploying with Local Mode

If your Mattermost server is running locally, you can enable [local mode](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/mmctl-cli-tool.html#local-mode) to streamline deploying your plugin. Edit your server configuration as follows:

```json
{
    "ServiceSettings": {
        ...
        "EnableLocalMode": true,
        "LocalModeSocketLocation": "/var/tmp/mattermost_local.socket"
    }
}
```

and then deploy your plugin:
```
make deploy
```

You may also customize the Unix socket path:
```
export MM_LOCALSOCKETPATH=/var/tmp/alternate_local.socket
make deploy
```

If developing a plugin with a webapp, watch for changes and deploy those automatically:
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make watch
```

### Deploying with credentials

Alternatively, you can authenticate with the server's API with credentials:
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
export MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
make deploy
```

or with a [personal access token](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/personal-access-tokens.html):
```
export MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL=http://localhost:8065
export MM_ADMIN_TOKEN=j44acwd8obn78cdcx7koid4jkr
make deploy
```

## Q&A

### How do I make a server-only or web app-only plugin?

Simply delete the `server` or `webapp` folders and remove the corresponding sections from `plugin.json`. The build scripts will skip the missing portions automatically.

### How do I include assets in the plugin bundle?

Place them into the `assets` directory. To use an asset at runtime, build the path to your asset and open as a regular file:

```go
bundlePath, err := p.API.GetBundlePath()
if err != nil {
    return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to get bundle path")
}

profileImage, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filepath.Join(bundlePath, "assets", "profile_image.png"))
if err != nil {
    return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to read profile image")
}

if appErr := p.API.SetProfileImage(userID, profileImage); appErr != nil {
    return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to set profile image")
}
```

### How do I build the plugin with unminified JavaScript?
Use `make dist-debug` and `make deploy-debug` in place of `make dist` and `make deploy` to configure webpack to generate unminified Javascript.
